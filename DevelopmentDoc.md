# Vocab Booster
> By Erik, Ishaan, Yam

## Introduction
Vocab Booster is a cross platform application that allows the users to maintain a collection of words and phrases, along with classification data such as their synonyms, types, meaning, sentences, etc. Additionally, users have the ability to optionally tag their words with certain identifiers to allow for enhanced memorization and improved searching. Users can also analyze their collection by visualizing the content added every week and classify those visualizations by the type of the word.
